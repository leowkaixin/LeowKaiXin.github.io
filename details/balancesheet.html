							<h2>Balance Sheet Details</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The Balance Sheet Storyboard displays details of the movements and porportion of each asset, liability and equity category. With the storyboard, the 
							user is able to make comparsions with balance sheets itself and other subsidiaries over accounting period of choice, allowing the organisation to 
							derive the most value from balance sheet and make more informed decisions. This storyboard consists of <b>5</b> dashboards: 
							<br>1. Overview
							<br>2. Assets
							<br>3. Liabilities
							<br>4. Equity 
							<br>5. Balance Sheet Analysis 
						</p>

						<p>The <b>first</b> dashboard is the Overview Dashboard. The dashboard showcases a summary of the organisation finances, i.e. the orgainsation's 
							financial position. The comparison charts compare assets, liabilities, and equity by category of the current year and month against that of 
							the previous month.
						</p>

						<p>The <b>second</b> dashboard is the Assets Dashboard. Assets are divided into 2 main categories: - Current Assets and Fixed Assets.
							<br>
							<br>The pie chart shows the subcategories present in the current assets, each slice of the pie chart is porportional to the value that it represents. 
							The trailing 12 months line chart allows the users to conduct trend analysis for each subcategory present. 
							
							<br>
							<br>The 6 cards are clickable for users to navigate to other dashboards for details, i.e. For Cash & Equivalent Card, the users are able to see cash and fixed 
							deposits in different currency, amount from different accounts, etc.
						</p>

						<p>The <b>third</b> dashboard is the Liabilities Dashboard. Liabilities are divided into 2 main categories: - Current Liabilities and Long-Term 
							Liabilities. 
							<br>
							<br>The 6 cards are also clickable for users to navigate to other dashboards for details, i.e. For 3rd Party Account Payables (AP) and Interco AP Cards, 
							the stacked bar chart shows change in porportion of each aging bucket over a span of 13 months and the amount the organisation owes its creditors.
						</p>
						<a class="image details"><img src="../images/BalanceSheet/BS_liabilities.PNG" alt="" /></a>

						<p>The <b>fourth</b> dashboard is the Equity Dashboard. Equity are divided into 3 main categories: - Share Capital, Retained Earnings, Other Reserves 
						</p>
						<a class="image details"><img src="../images/BalanceSheet/BS_equity.PNG" alt="" /></a>


						<p>The <b>final</b> dashboard is the Balance Sheet Analysis Dashboard. This dashboard is divided into 2 main categories: - Top 8 and All.
						<br>
						<br>In each category, the user is able to see the performance of 7 different metrics (Current Assets, Non-Current Assets, Total Assets, Current Liabilities, 
						Non-Current Liabilities, Total Liabilities, Net Assets, Equity) across either the Top 8 countries or by the regions (Europe, Asia, USA) respectively. 

						<br><br>The waterfall chart allows users to view the best and worse performing countries in each metric and comparsion. The left side of the waterfall chart 
						represents the previous month (PM) value while the right represents the actual (ACT) value. 

						<br><br>The bar chart on the right allows the users to compare between two metrics of their choice and the ability to toggle between 3 parameters, Actual (Act),
						Previous Year (PY) and Previous Month (PM).
