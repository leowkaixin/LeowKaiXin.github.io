							obligations and fund its operating expenses. The Storyboard consists of <b>5</b> dashboards:

						<p>The <b>third</b> dashboard is the CashFlow Overview Dashboard. The dashboard highlights the key metric (Free cashflow and operating cashflow ratio) as well as 
							overarching view of the cashflow activities. 
							
							<br><br>
							Free cashflow is the amount of cash a business has after meeting its financial obligations (i.e. paying for operations, interest, etc). This is an important metric 
							to our investors or the bank, as it reflects the health of the company. A high cash flow will then be able to indicate to the investor or the bank that the 
							organisation has enough cash to expand, and hence aid in money borrowing from the bank. 

							<br><br>
							Operating Cashflow Ratio is the measure of how well a company can pay off its current liabilities with the cash flow generated from its core business operations 
							(Operating Cash). The management will be able to have a view of the liquity of the company. High cash flow ratio would indicate that the company is able to generate
							enough cash to pay off its liabilities; Low cash flow ratio would be able to give off the signal to the management and investors that the company needs more cash.
