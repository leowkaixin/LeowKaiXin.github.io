							<h2>Profit and Loss Details</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The Profit and Loss (P&L) Storyboard displays details of the movements and porportion of revenue, material cost and material profit of each business 
							segment. With this storyboard, the user is able to monitor the financial performance of itself and other subsidiaries over accounting periods of choice. 
							The Storyboard consists of 5 dashboards: 
							<br>1. P&L Overview
							<br>2. Business Segment Overview
							<br>3. Non-material Cost (NMC) 
							<br>4. Selling, General & Administrative Expenses (SG&A) 
							<br>5. P&L Analysis
						</p>

						<p>The <b>first</b> dashboard is the P&L Overview Dashboard. The dashboard showcases a summary of the organisation finances, i.e. the orgainsation's 
							financial position. The meters showcases the KPIs, the orange line in each meter represetns the budget / target value. The higher the actual values 
							are above the budget value, the better it is for the organisation. Hence, if the actual values for these KPIs are above the budget value, the meter
							will turn green and vice versa. In addition, the previous year actual values are also displayed on the top-right hand corner for easy comparsion between
							this year's and the previous year's values. 
							<br><br>
							The table labelled "Income Statement" provides the user with a summary of the main sections of an entity's income statement. 
							The user will be able to identify the segments that required attention and delve deeper of the various sections if needed.

						<p>The <b>second</b> dashboard is the Business Segment Dashboard. In this dashboard, user is able see the comparsion between actual and budget values of 
							revenue, material cost and material profit across the subsegments present in each business segment.
						</p>
						<a class="image details"><img src="../images/Profit&Loss/PL_business_segment.PNG" alt="" /></a>

						<p>The <b>third</b> dashboard is the Non-material Cost (NMC) Dashboard. The dashboard contains the actual NMC and NMC Personnel Cost per headcount, the 
							difference between the previous and current year as well as the difference between actual and budget values. The Top 5 NMC accounts table allows the 
							user to quickly identify which accounts that are incurring the highest cost, as well as how much they are exceeding or falling below budget.
						</p>
						<a class="image details"><img src="../images/Profit&Loss/PL_NMC.PNG" alt="" /></a>

						<p>The <b>fourth</b> dashboard is the Selling, General & Administrative Expenses (SG&A) Dashboard. Similarly to NMC, the dashboard contains the actual SG&A,
							SG&A Personnel Cost per headcount and the Top 5 SG&A accounts table allowing the user to identify which accounts that are incurring the highest cost, as 
							well as how much they are exceeding or falling below budget. 
						</p>
						<a class="image details"><img src="../images/Profit&Loss/PL_SGA.PNG" alt="" /></a>

						<p>The <b>final</b> dashboard is the P&L Analysis Dashboard. This dashboard is divided into 2 main categories: 
						</br>1. Top 8
						</br>2. All

						</br><br>In each category, the user is able to see the performance of 6 different metrics (Revenue, Material Cost, Material Profit, SG&A, NMC, EBITDA) 
						across either the Top 8 countries or by the regions (Europe, Asia, USA) respectively.
						
						<br><br>The waterfall chart allows users to view the best and worse performing countries in each metric and comparsion. The starting bar represents the 
						budget value while the ending bar represents the actual value. 

						<br><br>The bar chart on the right allows the users to compare between two metrics of their choice and the ability to toggle between 4 parameters, 
						Actual (ACT), Budget (BUD), Previous Year (PY) and Previous Month (PM). This allows the user to compare the two metrics selected, along with the parameters 
						chosen across the Top 8 Countries easily.
